Lily's TODO:

- Watch the videos
- Take each video and classify it.  If it is a single class then its easy.  If its two or more classes the video should be split.
- create a document csv (name,class) or rename the file with the class "vid123-walking.mp4", "vid124-sitting.mp4"
- find some more videos!  this could be online videos of people walking or doing something related
- create your own vides!
- Will use a laptop for ML work.

Matt's TODO:

- create a running environment for GPU training - DONE
- AWS update
  - SageMaker works well for CPU based notebook work.
  - SageMaker Pro has higher performance systems available
  - SageMaker Pro will not provide me with GPU systems due to not enough AWS 'experience'
- Install MATLAB and try simple example


Timeline:

- Mar 19: Setup machine and get project running with repo.
  - extra credit: Create a script to adjust videos for resolution in python
